# Data Science Cheat Sheets

The field of data science is growing every day and keeping up with the new technologies and tools is essential for any successful data scientist (also data analyst, machine learning engineer, data engineer, etc).

The purpose of this repository is to be a quick refresher or reference. I try to keep it updated in a minimalized manner while providing most of the necessary information.


If you find other cheat sheet that could be added to this set or you want to suggest a new directory, please email me at:

I am also working on adding an online course, and a good project for each topic in the next few months.
